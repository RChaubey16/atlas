# NestJS Concepts Used in Atlas

This document explains every NestJS concept used in this project — from scratch, with real examples from the code. No prior NestJS knowledge required.

---

## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a framework for building backend servers in TypeScript. A framework is not a library you call — it is a structure you build inside. NestJS gives you a specific way to organise your code: where things live, how they connect, and how requests flow through the system.

Under the hood, NestJS sits on top of **Express** (the most popular Node.js HTTP server). You get Express's raw power with NestJS's organisation on top.

The three most important ideas in NestJS are: **Modules**, **Controllers**, and **Providers (Services)**. Everything else builds on these three.

---

## 1. Decorators — The @ Symbols

Before explaining modules, controllers, or services, you need to understand **decorators**, because they appear everywhere.

A decorator is a special annotation starting with `@` that you place above a class, method, or parameter. It attaches metadata or behaviour to whatever it decorates — without changing the code itself.

Think of decorators like labels on boxes. The box (your class) does the work; the label tells the framework what kind of box it is and how to use it.

```ts
@Controller('auth')   // ← decorator on the class: "this is a controller for /auth routes"
export class AuthController {

  @Post('register')   // ← decorator on the method: "this handles POST /auth/register"
  register(@Body() dto: RegisterDto) {  // ← decorator on the parameter: "give me the request body"
    return this.authService.register(dto);
  }
}
```

Decorators are a TypeScript feature that NestJS uses heavily. Once you know what each decorator means, the code becomes very readable.

---

## 2. Modules — Organising the Application

**File examples:** `apps/gateway/src/app.module.ts`, `apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.module.ts`

A **Module** is a logical grouping of related code. Every NestJS application has at least one module. Modules tell NestJS: "these controllers, services, and imports all belong together."

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/app.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule, ContentModule, DummyModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This is the root module of the Gateway. It imports two feature modules — one for auth routes and one for content routes. NestJS reads this and assembles the entire application from these pieces.

```ts
// apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [
    PassportModule,
    JwtModule.register({}),
  ],
  controllers: [AuthController],
  providers: [AuthService, JwtStrategy, PrismaService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

The `@Module` decorator accepts an object with four possible keys:

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `imports` | Other modules whose exported providers this module needs |
| `controllers` | The controllers (route handlers) that belong to this module |
| `providers` | Services, strategies, and other injectable classes |
| `exports` | Providers that other modules can use (not needed here yet) |

**Why modules?** Without them, everything would be wired together manually and the application would become one giant tangled file. Modules let you think in features: "the auth feature" is its own self-contained module.

---

## 3. Controllers — Handling HTTP Requests

**File examples:** `apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`, `apps/content-service/src/content/content.controller.ts`

A **Controller** is responsible for receiving incoming HTTP requests and returning responses. It is the outer layer — the thing the internet talks to.

Controllers do not contain business logic. They receive the request, pull out the relevant data, hand it to a service, and return whatever the service gives back.

```ts
// apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.controller.ts
@Controller('auth')                     // all routes in this controller start with /auth
export class AuthController {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {}

  @Post('register')                     // handles POST /auth/register
  register(@Body() dto: RegisterDto) {  // @Body() extracts the JSON body from the request
    return this.authService.register(dto);
  }

  @Post('login')                        // handles POST /auth/login
  login(@Body() dto: LoginDto) {
    return this.authService.login(dto);
  }

  @Post('refresh')
  refresh(@Body('refreshToken') refreshToken: string) {  // extracts just one field from the body
    return this.authService.refresh(refreshToken);
  }
}
```

### Route Decorators

These tell NestJS which HTTP method and path a handler responds to:

| Decorator | HTTP Method | Example URL |
|---|---|---|
| `@Get()` | GET | fetch data |
| `@Post()` | POST | create something |
| `@Put()` | PUT | replace something |
| `@Patch()` | PATCH | update part of something |
| `@Delete()` | DELETE | remove something |

### Parameter Decorators

These extract specific pieces from the incoming request:

| Decorator | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `@Body()` | The entire JSON body of the request |
| `@Body('key')` | A single field from the JSON body |
| `@Param('id')` | A URL parameter like `/content/:id` |
| `@Headers('x-user-id')` | A specific HTTP header value |
| `@Request()` | The full request object (used to access `req.user`) |

**From the content service:**
```ts
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param('id') id: string, @Headers('x-user-id') userId: string) {
  return this.contentService.findOneByOwner(id, userId);
}
```
This handles `GET /content/some-uuid`. The `:id` part is dynamic — NestJS extracts it and gives it to the method via `@Param('id')`.

---

## 4. Providers and Services — The Business Logic

**File examples:** `apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.service.ts`, `apps/content-service/src/content/content.service.ts`

A **Provider** is any class decorated with `@Injectable()`. The most common kind of provider is a **Service**.

Services contain the actual logic: database queries, password hashing, token generation, validation — all of that lives here, away from the controller.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(
    private readonly prisma: PrismaService,
    private readonly jwtService: JwtService,
  ) {}

  async register(dto: RegisterDto): Promise<TokenPair> {
    // check if email already exists
    // hash the password
    // save to database
    // return tokens
  }
}
```

`@Injectable()` is what marks a class as something NestJS can create and inject automatically. You declare it as a provider in a module, and NestJS handles creating it, passing its dependencies, and sharing it wherever it's needed.

---

## 5. Dependency Injection — How Things Connect

This is one of NestJS's most important concepts, and it is worth understanding deeply.

**Dependency Injection (DI)** means: instead of creating your own instances of things you depend on, you declare what you need and NestJS creates and provides them for you.

**Without DI (manual, fragile):**
```ts
// You'd have to do this yourself, everywhere
const prisma = new PrismaService();
const jwt = new JwtService();
const authService = new AuthService(prisma, jwt);
const authController = new AuthController(authService);
```

**With DI (NestJS way):**
```ts
// Just declare what you need in the constructor
export class AuthController {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {}
  // NestJS creates and injects AuthService automatically
}
```

NestJS maintains an **IoC container** (Inversion of Control) — essentially a registry of all providers. When a class declares a dependency in its constructor, NestJS looks it up in the registry and injects it automatically.

**How it works in this project:**

1. `AuthModule` registers `AuthService` and `PrismaService` as providers.
2. `AuthController` declares it needs `AuthService` in its constructor.
3. `AuthService` declares it needs `PrismaService` and `JwtService`.
4. NestJS creates `PrismaService` → then `JwtService` → then `AuthService` → then `AuthController`, passing each to the next.

You never call `new` on services. NestJS handles the whole chain.

**`private readonly` pattern:** The `private readonly authService: AuthService` shorthand in the constructor is TypeScript's way of both declaring a parameter AND assigning it as a class property in one line. It's used everywhere in this project.

---

## 6. Lifecycle Hooks — Responding to App Events

**File:** `apps/auth-service/src/prisma/prisma.service.ts`

NestJS provides special methods you can implement to hook into the application lifecycle — things like when the app starts or shuts down.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class PrismaService
  extends PrismaClient
  implements OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy
{
  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.$connect();   // called when this module is fully loaded — open DB connection
  }

  async onModuleDestroy() {
    await this.$disconnect(); // called when this module is shutting down — close DB connection
  }
}
```

`OnModuleInit` and `OnModuleDestroy` are **interfaces** from NestJS. By implementing them, you promise to provide `onModuleInit()` and `onModuleDestroy()` methods. NestJS calls these at the right moment automatically.

This is how `PrismaService` ensures the database connection opens when the service starts and closes cleanly when the server shuts down — without any manual wiring.

---

## 7. Guards — Protecting Routes

**Files:** `apps/gateway/src/auth/jwt-auth.guard.ts`, `apps/gateway/src/content/content-proxy.controller.ts`

A **Guard** is a class that decides whether a request is allowed to reach a controller method. It runs before the controller and returns either `true` (let it through) or `false` (reject it).

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/auth/jwt-auth.guard.ts
@Injectable()
export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {}
```

This guard extends NestJS Passport's built-in `AuthGuard`. When a request arrives, it looks for a JWT token in the `Authorization` header, verifies it using the JWT strategy, and either lets the request continue or throws a `401 Unauthorized` error.

Guards are applied with `@UseGuards()`:

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/content/content-proxy.controller.ts
@Controller('content')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)       // applied at the class level — protects ALL routes in this controller
export class ContentProxyController {

  @Post()
  create(@Body() body: unknown, @Request() req: AuthRequest) {
    // if we get here, the guard already verified the JWT
    // req.user is now populated with { userId, email }
    return this.contentProxy.createContent(body, req.user.userId);
  }
}
```

`@UseGuards()` can be placed on:
- A single method — protects only that route
- A class — protects all routes in the controller
- Globally (in `main.ts`) — protects every route in the entire application

**Intentionally public routes** omit `@UseGuards` entirely. In this project, `DummyProxyController` has no guard — it is meant to be reachable without a token. This is a deliberate design choice, not an oversight. The absence of `@UseGuards` is itself the declaration that a route is public.

---

## 8. Strategies (Passport) — Authentication Logic

**Files:** `apps/gateway/src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts`, `apps/auth-service/src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`, `apps/gateway/src/auth/strategies/google.strategy.ts`

**Passport** is a popular authentication library for Node.js. NestJS integrates it via `@nestjs/passport`. A **Strategy** defines *how* to authenticate. This project uses two strategies.

### JWT Strategy — verifying tokens on protected routes

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts
@Injectable()
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor() {
    super({
      jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
      // ↑ tells Passport: "look for the token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header"

      secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_ACCESS_SECRET ?? '',
      // ↑ the secret key used to verify the token's signature
    });
  }

  validate(payload: JwtPayload) {
    // ↑ called automatically after the token is verified
    // whatever you return here becomes req.user
    return { userId: payload.sub, email: payload.email };
  }
}
```

**How Guard and Strategy work together:**

```
Request arrives with: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc...

  JwtAuthGuard triggers
       ↓
  JwtStrategy.validate() is called
       ↓
  Token is verified against JWT_ACCESS_SECRET
       ↓
  If valid → { userId, email } is attached to req.user
  If invalid → 401 Unauthorized is returned immediately
```

### Google Strategy — OAuth 2.0 browser-based login

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/auth/strategies/google.strategy.ts
@Injectable()
export class GoogleStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy, 'google') {
  constructor() {
    super({
      clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      callbackURL: process.env.GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL,
      scope: ['email', 'profile'],
    });
  }

  validate(_accessToken, _refreshToken, profile, done) {
    // ↑ called after Google confirms the user's identity
    // extracts the fields we care about and passes them to the controller via req.user
    const user = {
      googleId: profile.id,
      email: profile.emails[0].value,
      name: profile.displayName,
    };
    done(null, user);
  }
}
```

The second argument to `PassportStrategy(Strategy, 'google')` names the strategy `'google'`. This is what `GoogleAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('google')` refers to. Without the name, it would conflict with the default `'jwt'` strategy.

**How the Google OAuth flow works with Guards and Strategy:**

```
GET /auth/google
  GoogleAuthGuard triggers
       ↓
  Passport sees no session yet → calls Strategy to redirect
       ↓
  Browser is sent to Google's consent screen (302)

Google authenticates the user and redirects to:
GET /auth/google/callback?code=...
  GoogleAuthGuard triggers again
       ↓
  Passport exchanges the code for a Google profile
       ↓
  GoogleStrategy.validate() is called with the profile
       ↓
  { googleId, email, name } is attached to req.user
       ↓
  Controller calls Auth Service to find/create user and issue JWT pair
```

The Guard is the enforcer. The Strategy is the logic it delegates to. Both are registered as providers in the module.

---

## 9. Pipes and Validation — Checking Incoming Data

**Files:** `apps/auth-service/src/main.ts`, `apps/auth-service/src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`

A **Pipe** transforms or validates incoming data before it reaches the controller method. If validation fails, NestJS automatically returns a `400 Bad Request` error with details — the controller method is never even called.

**Enabling validation globally (in `main.ts`):**
```ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true }));
  //                                      ↑ strips any extra fields not declared in the DTO
  await app.listen(3001);
}
```

`ValidationPipe` works together with **DTOs** and the `class-validator` library.

### DTOs — Data Transfer Objects

A **DTO** (Data Transfer Object) is a simple class that describes the shape of incoming data and declares validation rules using decorators.

```ts
// apps/auth-service/src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts
import { IsEmail, IsString, MinLength } from 'class-validator';

export class RegisterDto {
  @IsEmail()           // must be a valid email format
  email: string;

  @IsString()          // must be a string
  @MinLength(8)        // must be at least 8 characters
  password: string;
}
```

When the controller declares `@Body() dto: RegisterDto`, NestJS:
1. Takes the raw JSON from the request body.
2. Creates a `RegisterDto` instance from it.
3. Runs `ValidationPipe` which checks all the `class-validator` decorators.
4. If any check fails → returns `400 Bad Request` automatically.
5. If all pass → calls the controller method with the validated object.

**`whitelist: true`** means NestJS strips any extra fields the client sends that are not declared in the DTO. This prevents attackers from sneaking in unexpected data.

---

## 10. Exception Handling — Returning Proper HTTP Errors

**File:** `apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.service.ts`

NestJS provides a set of built-in exception classes that map directly to HTTP status codes. You throw them anywhere in your code and NestJS catches them and returns the correct response.

```ts
async register(dto: RegisterDto) {
  const existing = await this.prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: dto.email } });

  if (existing) {
    throw new ConflictException('Email already in use');
    // ↑ NestJS returns: HTTP 409 Conflict  { "message": "Email already in use" }
  }
}

async login(dto: LoginDto) {
  // ...
  if (!valid) {
    throw new UnauthorizedException('Invalid credentials');
    // ↑ NestJS returns: HTTP 401 Unauthorized  { "message": "Invalid credentials" }
  }
}
```

Common built-in exceptions:

| Exception Class | HTTP Status | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `BadRequestException` | 400 | Invalid input that slipped past validation |
| `UnauthorizedException` | 401 | Not logged in / bad token |
| `ForbiddenException` | 403 | Logged in but not allowed |
| `NotFoundException` | 404 | Resource does not exist |
| `ConflictException` | 409 | Duplicate data (e.g., email taken) |
| `GoneException` | 410 | Resource existed but is no longer available (e.g., expired short link) |

From the content service:
```ts
async findOneByOwner(id: string, ownerId: string) {
  const item = await this.prisma.content.findUnique({ where: { id } });
  if (!item) throw new NotFoundException('Content not found');     // 404
  if (item.ownerId !== ownerId) throw new ForbiddenException();   // 403
  return item;
}
```

---

## 11. HttpModule — Making Requests to Other Services

**Files:** `apps/gateway/src/auth/auth-proxy.service.ts`, `apps/gateway/src/content/content-proxy.service.ts`

The Gateway needs to forward requests to the Auth Service and Content Service. It does this using `@nestjs/axios`, which wraps the popular `axios` HTTP client in a NestJS-friendly injectable service.

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/auth/auth-proxy.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class AuthProxyService {
  private readonly authUrl = process.env.AUTH_SERVICE_URL ?? 'http://localhost:3001';

  constructor(private readonly http: HttpService) {}
  //                              ↑ injected by NestJS, provided by HttpModule

  async login(body: unknown) {
    const { data } = await firstValueFrom(
      this.http.post(`${this.authUrl}/auth/login`, body),
      //         ↑ makes an HTTP POST to the Auth Service
    );
    return data;
  }
}
```

`HttpService` returns **Observables** (from RxJS, a reactive programming library). `firstValueFrom()` converts the Observable into a regular Promise so you can use `await` with it. This is the standard pattern in this codebase.

To use `HttpService`, the module must import `HttpModule`:
```ts
@Module({
  imports: [PassportModule, HttpModule],  // ← HttpModule provides HttpService
  ...
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

---

## 12. ScheduleModule and `@Cron` — Recurring Background Jobs

**Files:** `apps/url-shortener/src/links/cleanup.service.ts`, `apps/url-shortener/src/app.module.ts`

`@nestjs/schedule` adds cron job support to NestJS. You enable it once in the root module and then annotate any service method with `@Cron()` to have NestJS call it on a schedule — no external process manager or OS cron needed.

**Registering the scheduler (once, in AppModule):**
```ts
// apps/url-shortener/src/app.module.ts
import { ScheduleModule } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Module({
  imports: [ScheduleModule.forRoot(), LinksModule, RedirectModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

`ScheduleModule.forRoot()` boots the scheduler. It must be called in the root module so it is ready before any `@Cron` method fires.

**Declaring a cron job:**
```ts
// apps/url-shortener/src/links/cleanup.service.ts
import { Cron } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Injectable()
export class CleanupService {
  constructor(private readonly prisma: PrismaService) {}

  @Cron('0 2 * * *')   // ← standard cron expression: "at 02:00 every day"
  async deleteExpiredLinks(): Promise<void> {
    await this.prisma.shortLink.deleteMany({
      where: { expiresAt: { lt: new Date() } },
    });
  }
}
```

`@Cron()` accepts a standard 5-field cron expression (`minute hour day month weekday`) or one of NestJS's named constants (`CronExpression.EVERY_DAY_AT_2AM`, etc.).

The method is called automatically at the scheduled time. It does not need to be called anywhere else. NestJS handles registration and execution.

**Cron expression cheat-sheet:**

| Expression | When it runs |
|---|---|
| `'0 2 * * *'` | Every day at 2:00 AM |
| `'*/5 * * * *'` | Every 5 minutes |
| `'0 0 * * 0'` | Every Sunday at midnight |
| `'0 9 1 * *'` | 9 AM on the 1st of every month |

`CleanupService` must be listed as a provider in the module that provides `PrismaService`. It does not need to be exported — it runs silently in the background.

---

## 13. The `@Redirect()` Decorator — Issuing HTTP Redirects

**File:** `apps/url-shortener/src/redirect/redirect.controller.ts`

NestJS has a built-in `@Redirect()` decorator for controller methods that should respond with an HTTP redirect instead of a JSON body. When used without arguments, the method's return value controls the destination and status code.

```ts
// apps/url-shortener/src/redirect/redirect.controller.ts
@Controller('s')
export class RedirectController {
  constructor(private readonly linksService: LinksService) {}

  @Get(':slug')
  @Redirect()           // ← tells NestJS: "the return value is a redirect, not JSON"
  async redirect(@Param('slug') slug: string) {
    const url = await this.linksService.resolveAndTrack(slug);
    return { url, statusCode: 302 };
    //       ↑ NestJS reads these two fields and issues the redirect automatically
  }
}
```

When `@Redirect()` is used without arguments, NestJS expects the method to return an object with:
- `url` — the destination to redirect to
- `statusCode` — the HTTP status code (302 = temporary redirect, 301 = permanent)

If the method throws before returning (e.g. `NotFoundException` or `GoneException`), NestJS serves the error response instead — no redirect is issued.

**At the gateway layer**, the redirect controller works differently because it needs full control of the raw Express response:

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/url-shortener/url-shortener-redirect.controller.ts
@Controller('s')
export class UrlShortenerRedirectController {
  @Get(':slug')
  async redirect(@Param('slug') slug: string, @Res() res: Response) {
    const targetUrl = await this.proxy.resolveSlug(slug);
    return res.redirect(302, targetUrl);
    //         ↑ Express's redirect method — used when @Res() is injected directly
  }
}
```

`@Res()` gives you the raw Express `Response` object. Using it opts the method out of NestJS's automatic response handling — you must call `res.redirect()` (or `res.json()`, etc.) yourself.

---

## 15. JwtModule — Signing and Verifying Tokens

**File:** `apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.module.ts`

`@nestjs/jwt` wraps the `jsonwebtoken` library and provides a `JwtService` injectable.

```ts
@Module({
  imports: [
    PassportModule,
    JwtModule.register({}),   // registers JwtService as a provider with no default config
  ],
  providers: [AuthService, JwtStrategy, PrismaService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

`JwtModule.register({})` is called with an empty object because in this project the secret and expiry are passed per-call (at sign time), rather than as defaults. This gives flexibility to use different secrets for access vs refresh tokens.

**Using `JwtService`:**
```ts
// Signing (creating a token)
const accessToken = this.jwtService.sign(
  { sub: userId, email },          // the payload — data baked into the token
  {
    secret: process.env.JWT_ACCESS_SECRET,
    expiresIn: 60 * 15,            // 15 minutes in seconds
  }
);

// Verifying (checking a token)
const payload = this.jwtService.verify<{ sub: string; email: string }>(
  refreshToken,
  { secret: process.env.JWT_REFRESH_SECRET },
);
```

## 16. NestJS Monorepo — One Repo, Multiple Apps

**File:** `nest-cli.json`

By default NestJS creates a single application. This project uses **monorepo mode**, where multiple applications and libraries live inside one repository, sharing the same `node_modules` and tooling.

```json
{
  "monorepo": true,
  "root": "apps/gateway",
  "projects": {
    "gateway":         { "type": "application", "root": "apps/gateway" },
    "auth-service":    { "type": "application", "root": "apps/auth-service" },
    "content-service": { "type": "application", "root": "apps/content-service" },
    "url-shortener":   { "type": "application", "root": "apps/url-shortener" },
    "contracts":       { "type": "library",     "root": "libs/contracts" }
  }
}
```

**Applications** (`type: application`) are runnable servers — each starts its own process, listens on its own port.

**Libraries** (`type: library`) are shared code — they don't run on their own. Other apps import from them.

**Building a specific app:**
```bash
nest build gateway          # compiles only the gateway
nest build auth-service     # compiles only the auth service
nest build url-shortener    # compiles only the url-shortener service
```

**Path aliases for libraries:**

When `contracts` is a library, importing it by relative path from deep inside an app would be ugly:
```ts
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '../../../../libs/contracts/src';  // messy
```

NestJS sets up TypeScript path aliases so you can write:
```ts
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '@app/contracts';  // clean
```

This is configured in `tsconfig.json`:
```json
"paths": {
  "@app/contracts": ["libs/contracts/src"],
  "@app/contracts/*": ["libs/contracts/src/*"]
}
```

**Contracts can export runtime values, not just types:**

A common mistake is treating `libs/contracts` as a types-only library. It can export any valid TypeScript — including runtime objects and maps that exist at runtime and can be iterated over.

In this project, `libs/contracts/src/templates/registry.ts` exports a plain object:

```ts
export const TEMPLATES: Record<string, TemplateDefinition> = {
  'welcome': welcomeTemplate,
  'password-reset': passwordResetTemplate,
  'feature-announcement': featureAnnouncementTemplate,
};
```

The Gateway's `TemplatesController` imports this map directly and returns it from an HTTP endpoint — no database, no downstream service:

```ts
// apps/gateway/src/templates/templates.controller.ts
import { TEMPLATES } from '@app/contracts';

@Controller('templates')
export class TemplatesController {
  @Get()
  list() {
    return Object.values(TEMPLATES).map(({ id, name, description, subject, fields }) => ({
      id, name, description, subject, fields,
    }));
  }

  @Get(':id/preview')
  preview(@Param('id') id: string) {
    const template = TEMPLATES[id];
    if (!template) throw new NotFoundException(`Template "${id}" not found`);
    return { id: template.id, subject: template.subject, html: template.html(template.previewData) };
  }
}
```

This pattern is appropriate when the data is static and known at build time. If templates were user-configurable and stored in a database, you would query them in a service instead.

## 17. NestJS Microservices — Event-Driven Services

**Files:** `apps/notification-service/src/main.ts`, `apps/notification-service/src/notification/notification.service.ts`, `apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.module.ts`, `apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.service.ts`

NestJS supports running services as **microservices** — processes that communicate not via HTTP but via a message broker (in this project, RabbitMQ). A microservice has no HTTP port; it connects to a queue and waits for messages.

### Bootstrapping a Microservice

A pure microservice (no HTTP) uses `NestFactory.createMicroservice()`:

```ts
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(
  NotificationModule,
  {
    transport: Transport.RMQ,
    options: {
      urls: [process.env.RABBITMQ_URL ?? 'amqp://localhost:5672'],
      queue: 'notification_queue',
      queueOptions: { durable: true },
    },
  },
);
await app.listen();  // connects to RabbitMQ — no HTTP port opened
```

### Bootstrapping a Hybrid App (HTTP + microservice in one process)

The Notification Service runs as a **hybrid** — it handles both HTTP requests and RabbitMQ messages in the same process. You start with `NestFactory.create()` (HTTP), then attach the microservice transport with `connectMicroservice()`:

```ts
// apps/notification-service/src/main.ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(NotificationModule);
  //          ↑ standard HTTP app — enables body parsing, global pipes, etc.

  app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>({
    transport: Transport.RMQ,
    options: {
      urls: [process.env.RABBITMQ_URL ?? 'amqp://localhost:5672'],
      queue: 'notification_queue',
      queueOptions: { durable: true },
    },
  });

  await app.startAllMicroservices();
  //    ↑ connects to RabbitMQ and starts consuming messages

  await app.listen(process.env.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PORT ?? 3004);
  //    ↑ also opens an HTTP port for direct API calls
}
```

The same controller class can have both `@EventPattern` methods (consumed via RabbitMQ) and `@Post` methods (consumed via HTTP) — NestJS routes each message to the right handler based on the transport context.

**One important nuance with guards in hybrid apps:** guards that call `context.switchToHttp()` (like `InternalKeyGuard`) only apply when the method is called via HTTP. When an `@EventPattern` handler fires via RabbitMQ, the execution context is `RpcContext`, not `HttpContext`. A method-level `@UseGuards()` on the HTTP handler does not affect the RMQ handler in the same controller, so the two can coexist safely.

### Consuming Events — `@EventPattern` and `@Payload`

On the consumer side, you mark a method with `@EventPattern()` to tell NestJS: "call this method whenever a message with this event name arrives."

```ts
// apps/notification-service/src/notification/notification.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class NotificationService {
  constructor(private readonly emailService: EmailService) {}

  @EventPattern(USER_CREATED_EVENT)          // listen for 'user.created' messages
  async handleUserCreated(
    @Payload() event: UserCreatedEvent,      // @Payload() extracts the message body
  ): Promise<void> {
    await this.emailService.sendMail(event.email, new WelcomeEmailTemplate());
  }
}
```

`@EventPattern` is the microservice equivalent of `@Post()` — it registers a handler for a specific message type.

`@Payload()` is the microservice equivalent of `@Body()` — it extracts the data from the incoming message.

### Publishing Events — `ClientProxy` and `ClientsModule`

On the publisher side (auth-service), you register a **client** that knows how to send messages to the queue:

```ts
// apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [
    ClientsModule.register([
      {
        name: 'NOTIFICATION_SERVICE',          // injection token
        transport: Transport.RMQ,
        options: {
          urls: [process.env.RABBITMQ_URL ?? 'amqp://localhost:5672'],
          queue: 'notification_queue',
          queueOptions: { durable: true },
        },
      },
    ]),
  ],
  ...
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

`ClientsModule.register()` creates a `ClientProxy` and registers it in the DI container under the token `'NOTIFICATION_SERVICE'`. You inject it with `@Inject()`:

```ts
// apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(
    private readonly prisma: PrismaService,
    private readonly jwtService: JwtService,
    @Inject('NOTIFICATION_SERVICE') private readonly notificationClient: ClientProxy,
    //       ↑ string token, so @Inject() is needed instead of the automatic type-based injection
  ) {}

  async register(dto: RegisterDto): Promise<TokenPair> {
    // ... save user ...

    // Fire-and-forget: emit() returns an Observable but we don't subscribe.
    // RabbitMQ transport buffers the message; no subscription needed for delivery.
    this.notificationClient.emit(USER_CREATED_EVENT, event);

    return this.issueTokens(user.id, user.email);
  }
}
```

`emit()` is fire-and-forget — it sends the message and returns immediately. The HTTP response is not delayed waiting for the email to be sent.

### Why String Tokens?

Normally NestJS injects by type — `private readonly jwtService: JwtService` works automatically because TypeScript knows the type. String tokens (`'NOTIFICATION_SERVICE'`) are used when the same type (`ClientProxy`) could refer to different clients (e.g., one for notifications, one for analytics). The `@Inject('...')` decorator tells NestJS which specific client to use.

### HTTP Service vs Microservice vs Hybrid

| | HTTP Service (gateway, auth, content, url-shortener) | Pure Microservice | Hybrid (notification) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap | `NestFactory.create()` | `NestFactory.createMicroservice()` | `NestFactory.create()` + `connectMicroservice()` |
| Transport | HTTP (port) | RabbitMQ (queue) | Both |
| Receives | HTTP requests | Queue messages | HTTP requests AND queue messages |
| Route handler | `@Get()`, `@Post()` | `@EventPattern()` | Both, in the same controller |
| Data extraction | `@Body()`, `@Param()` | `@Payload()` | Both |
| Response | Returns data to caller | Acknowledges message | Returns data (HTTP) or acknowledges (RMQ) |

## 18. NestFactory — Bootstrapping the Application (HTTP Services)

**File:** `apps/auth-service/src/main.ts`

Every NestJS app starts in a `main.ts` file. `NestFactory.create()` boots the entire application: it reads the root module, resolves all dependencies, and starts the HTTP server.

```ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  // ↑ reads AppModule, wires all providers, controllers, and modules

  app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true }));
  // ↑ applies the validation pipe to every route in this entire application

  await app.listen(process.env.AUTH_SERVICE_PORT ?? 3001);
  // ↑ starts listening for HTTP requests on port 3001
}
bootstrap();
```

`bootstrap` is just an async function — the `async/await` is needed because starting an HTTP server is an asynchronous operation.

## 19. How All the Concepts Connect — Full Picture

Here is how a `POST /auth/register` request flows through all these NestJS concepts:

```
1. CLIENT sends:  POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register
                  Body: { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "secret123" }

2. GATEWAY (NestFactory started on port 3000)
   → AuthProxyController receives the request  (@Controller('auth') + @Post('register'))
   → No guard on this route, so it passes straight through
   → AuthProxyService.register(body) is called
   → HttpService makes a POST to http://auth-service:3001/auth/register

3. AUTH SERVICE (NestFactory started on port 3001)
   → Request arrives at AuthController  (@Controller('auth') + @Post('register'))
   → ValidationPipe runs on the body
       - Checks @IsEmail() → valid
       - Checks @MinLength(8) → "secret123" is 9 chars → valid
   → AuthController calls authService.register(dto)
   → AuthService:
       - Queries DB: does this email exist? No.
       - Hashes the password with bcrypt
       - Saves the user via PrismaService
       - Logs the user.created event
       - Signs an accessToken (expires 15min) and refreshToken (expires 7 days)
       - Returns { accessToken, refreshToken }
   → AuthController returns the token pair

4. GATEWAY
   → Receives { accessToken, refreshToken } from Auth Service
   → Passes it straight back to the client

5. CLIENT receives: { "accessToken": "eyJ...", "refreshToken": "eyJ..." }
```
